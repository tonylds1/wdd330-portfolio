                    <h2> Problems with two github accounts at the same computer.</h2>
                    <p>
                        I had problems to make github works for two accounts. I tryied follow <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574">this solution</a>
                        but it does not worked as I thought. The solution is to use the primary one by sharing it with both accounts.

                    <h2> Bootstrap/jquery libraries</h2>
                    <p>
                        Is there any problem using bootstrap and jquery to make the page better and help to focus on the class subject?
