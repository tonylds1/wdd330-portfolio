                    <h2> About Calling Methods</h2>
                    <p>
                        object.method() is equivalent to object['method']()
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <h2>About properties</h2>
                    <p>
                        use the method hasOwnProperty for checking if a property exists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        each property is like an element of an array/dictionary that have a key and a value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        we can add and remove properties on the fly. It works even with those declared with const.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        for Json: double-quoted property names, restricter values allowed and  methods not allowed
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Another Built-in objects: Date, RegExp</p>

                    <p>
                        querySelector and querySelectorAll look for css selectors to retorn eleents
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ATENTION: when we are looking for an element and there is more than one option for the query, the querySelector will return just the last one.

                        keydown, keypress, keyup and many others allow us to capture keyboards typing events. The same could be done with the mouse but the events names are different.

                    <h2> About Classes</h2>
                    <p>
                        if we have an object probably we should have a defition to that object, or in other words, a class. Is that true?
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Pure javascript vs jquery</h2>
                    <p>
                        The text tell us to use queryselector or getElementById. If I were using jquery I could use simple $('...') to get the element. There is real professionals projects that use queryselector nowadays?
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>

                    <h2>Where to bind the events</h2>
                    <p>
                        We can bind an event to an element at the same element using on{Event}="...". There is a rule to decide where is the better place?
                    </p>

                    <h2>Binding events</h2>
                    <p>
                        There is any method that list all event binded by the user? In other words, events not default?
